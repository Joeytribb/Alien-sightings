            <h2>A Statistical Journey Through Reported Phenomena</h2>
            <p>This interactive exploration delves into a global dataset of publicly reported UFO sightings. From an initial collection, this analysis focuses on <strong id="total-sightings">N/A</strong> rigorously cleaned and validated records. Using statistical techniques, we aim to uncover robust patterns, trends, and distinguishing characteristics from these intriguing accounts. The 3D globe visualization above plots these sightings, with point size logarithmically scaled to the reported duration of the event.</p>

                <h3>Key Statistical Findings:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peak reporting activity consistently occurs during the evening, typically around <strong id="peak-hour">N/A</strong>. During this specific window, the dominant reported shape is '<strong id="peak-hour-dominant-shape">N/A</strong>'. <span class="insight-detail">(See: <a href="#temporal-analysis">Temporal</a> & <a href="#morphological-analysis">Morphological Analysis</a>)</span></li>
                    <li>The month of <strong id="peak-month">N/A</strong> shows the highest frequency of UFO sighting reports annually. <span class="insight-detail">(See: <a href="#temporal-analysis">Temporal Analysis</a>)</span></li>
                    <li>The most frequently described shape (excluding ambiguous terms) is '<strong id="most-common-shape">N/A</strong>', followed by '<strong id="second-most-common-shape">N/A</strong>'. <span class="insight-detail">(See: <a href="#morphological-analysis">Morphological Analysis</a>)</span></li>
                    <li>Analysis of sighting durations for top shapes reveals that '<strong id="shape-longest-duration">N/A</strong>' reports tend to have the longest median observation time (<strong id="median-duration-longest-shape">N/A</strong>s), while '<strong id="shape-shortest-duration">N/A</strong>' reports have the shortest (<strong id="median-duration-shortest-shape">N/A</strong>s). <span class="insight-detail">(See: <a href="#morphological-analysis">Morphological Analysis</a>)</span></li>
                    <li>Night-time sightings (median: <strong id="median-duration-night">N/A</strong>s) are reported as lasting significantly longer on average than daytime sightings (median: <strong id="median-duration-day">N/A</strong>s). <span class="insight-detail">(See: <a href="#morphological-analysis">Duration Details</a>)</span></li>
                    <li>A notable <strong id="proportion-over-5-min">N/A%</strong> of sightings are reported to last longer than 5 minutes, with <strong id="proportion-over-1-hour">N/A%</strong> extending beyond an hour.</li>
                    <li>The median duration across all valid sightings is approximately <strong id="median-duration-overall">N/A</strong> seconds. The year <strong id="peak-year">N/A</strong> saw a peak in reporting frequency.</li>

            <p>The 3D globe offers an interactive visualization of global sighting distribution. Below, we quantify this by examining the most common reporting locations at national and sub-national (US States) levels based on the available data.</p>

            <h2>Morphological Characteristics & Duration Analysis</h2>
            <p>UFOs are reported in various forms. This section details the most common shapes described by observers (excluding 'various' or 'unknown') and explores how reported sighting durations vary across these morphologies and by time of day.</p>

                <h4>Duration Details by Shape and Time of Day:</h4>
                <p>The data suggests interesting variations in reported sighting durations. For instance, among the most common shapes, the median duration for '<strong id="text-shape-longest">N/A</strong>' sightings is <strong id="text-median-longest">N/A</strong> seconds, potentially differing from '<strong id="text-shape-shortest">N/A</strong>' sightings at <strong id="text-median-shortest">N/A</strong> seconds. Reports also indicate that sightings during night hours tend to have longer median durations compared to those during the day. These descriptive statistics hint at patterns that could be explored further with inferential testing.</p>
                 <p id="peak-hour-shapes-detail">During the peak sighting hour of <strong id="peak-hour-detail-time">N/A</strong>, the most frequently reported shapes include: <strong id="peak-hour-detail-shapes">N/A</strong>.</p>
